	  	<h1>Knyts – Streetwear E-commerce Retail Site</h1>
	  	<p>
	  		Knyts is a streetwear clothing store started in 1994 with own more than 400 physical stores worldwide. Their target audience is people of all ages who care about affordable yet decent quality clothing. With COVID-19, many of their stores were affected and the company is looking to transition their successful business online to make it accessible for all their users.
	  	</p>
          <p>Goal: We want to know what about the ideal online shopping experience makes it so compelling to users and what features or tools are important so that we can incorporate them into Knyts digital presence.</p>
	  	<p>
	  		My role in this project is to design a responsive online store to increase their base market and to mimic the in store shopping experience.

	                Since Knyts had no online digital presence, I had the responsibility of creating the brand identity for company. This involved devising the naming, logo, colors, typography and various interface assets.
	            </p>
	            <p>
	                Knyts' main goal is to make any type of clothing accessible to everyone. They believe clothing doesn’t have to be expensive and last forever--that we should be able to change styles as we need and please. Brand positioning for Knyts followed our desire to appeal to and maintain our high fashion aficionados and trendy influencer market base.

	            	I began with several current studies of the e-commerce retail industry. This included doing secondary research of overall industry trends as well as competitive analysis of competitor offerings, strengths, and weaknesses. I also conducted 1-on-1 User Interviews to learn first-hand about people's shopping behaviors.</p><br>
	            <p> 
	            	The most common issues I heard from frequent online shoppers was around cluttered and inconsistent design, affordability, and discoverability in their overall shopping experience. I also needed to reconcile this with Knyts business pain points around increasing brand loyalty and sales, accessibility, and having optimized search for users to easily find products.
	            </p><br>
	            <p>
	            	With this information in hand we decided that the driving principle of our user experience should be around simplicity and accessibility. In order to make a truly useful and engaging online shopping experience, we needed to make it effortless to find a product, decide if they want to purchase an item based on reviews and other product information, and purchase it seamlessly.
