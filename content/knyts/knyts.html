	  	<h1>Knyts – Streetwear E-commerce Retail Site</h1><br>
        <h2>Background</h2>
	  	<p>
	  		Knyts is a streetwear clothing store started in 1994 with own more than 400 physical stores worldwide. Their target audience is people of all ages who care about affordable yet decent quality clothing. With COVID-19, many of their stores were affected and the company is looking to transition their successful business online to make it accessible for all their users.
	  	</p><br>
          <h2>Role</h2>
          <p>My role as a UX Designer was to understand what about the ideal online shopping experience makes it so compelling to users and what features or tools are important so that we can incorporate them into Knyts digital presence.</p><br>
          <h2>Solution & Result</h2>
	  	<p>
	  		A responsive online store to increase their base market, mimic the in store shopping experience, and easily find sustainable clothes and relevant information needed (size, fit, reviews) to build their confidence that they are making the correct purchase.

      	<h2>Empathize</h2>
	      	<p>
	      		I utilized both secondary research on the e-commerce retail space and one on one user interviews of frequent online shoppers to:
            <ol class="largeText">
                <li>Determine what aspects of an online store are the most helpful and important to users
                </li><br>
                <li>Understand what the average online shopper needs and wants out of their experience
                </li><br>
                <li>Understand the user flow of an average shopper and mitigate any confusion
                </li><br>
                <li>Determine if there are any affordances from the in-person shopping experience that can be easily translate online</li>
            </ol>
	      	</p><br>
            <img class="casestudy-pic" data-src="companal.png">
	      	<p>
	      		Using the findings from users interviews, I created a persona, Joshua, to keep me user-centered as I brainstormed solutions. I also created an empathy map to understand my persona - and users - in a more holistic way. 
	      	</p>

            <div class="contentBox">

    <div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 	
      	<h2>Define - Creating a Seamless Shopping Experience</h2>
	      	<p>
	      		To think keep features user-centered, I articulated Problem Statements and How Might We questions (HMW) based on the research. The design was centered around helping users find quality items that is the correct size.
            <ol class="largeText">
                <li>How might we help Joshua find quality pants that fit him perfectly?
                </li><br>
                <li>How might we assist Joshua in his discovery of the latest trendy clothes?
                </li><br>
                <li>How might we make the shopping process seamless and intuitive for Joshua?
                </li>
            </ol>
	      	</p>

     <div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 	
      	<h2>Ideate - Simplifying the Process</h2>
	      	<p>
	      		I had many ideas of what could be on the website, so I narrowed down the most important features that would make a seamless online shopping experience into the project roadmap. From there, I also did an open card sort that helped me grouped features that intuitively went well together. This led to the creation of a site map. This organized categories in a clear way so that users could have an easy to navigate online shopping experience.
         </p>
    
         <p>

                I spent time considering these two things, because I knew that if the website was hard to use, shoppers would be less inclined to make purchases at Knyts online. An easy to navigate website did not only benefit shoppers, it also would be highly beneficial to Knyts meeting their business goals.

             <p class="col_large caption">A user flow helped me understand the user’s actions and decisions points as they complete a task. This also shows the number of screens that a user may encounter when completing that task.</p>

        <div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 	
      	<h2>Build - Wireframing & Brand Identity</h2>
	      	<p>
	      		From the user flow, I built mid-fidelity wireframes to put all the features together! These wireframes show the screens that a shopper would encounter when they went online shopping for pants. 
         </p>
         <br>
            <img class="casestudy-pic" data-src="wireframes.png">
            <h2>Logo and Style Tile</h2>
         <p>
               I wanted to bring out themes I gathered from Knyts: clean, modern, trendy, and memorable style. From that, I developed a minimalistic design with eye-catching tones to emulate the urban and streetwear theme. To start, I created a style tile to give a visual representation of Knyts.
	      	</p><br>
            <img class="casestudy-pic" data-src="styletile.png">
            <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
         <p>
               In starting my design of the Knyts website, I first made responsive designs so that users could access the site in multiple different platforms. This makes it easy for shoppers to shop anytime and anywhere.
	      	</p><br>
            <img class="casestudy-pic" data-src="devices.png">
            <h2>UI Screens and High-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
         <p>
               Then, I created the other UI screens and created my high-fidelity prototype. Here is a sample of my final UI screens.
	      	</p><br>

        <div class="textCont2 largeText2"> 	
      	<h2>Testing - Revisions & Reflections</h2>
	      	<p>
	      		Once I had my high-fidelity prototype working, I recruited 5 participants to test the prototype and observe how they completed each task. From the results and notes I gathered I created an affinity map to prioritize revisions and discover common patterns and pain points. 
         </p>
         <br>
            <img class="casestudy-pic" data-src="affinity map.png">
            <h2>Key Takeaways & Future Plans</h2>
            <p>
	      		This project helped me understand the value of user research and how to conduct research to meet our specific objectives. I also learned how to incorporate this data throughout the duration of the project to justify data-driven design decisions and optimize for the best user experience.<br><br>
                After implementing changes to alleviate original pain points, I will need to conduct further usability testing and research to uncover additional pain points and make more easy to navigate paths for different tasks. Specifically, I will need to conduct A/B testing to see if users are more familiar with a heart icon or bookmark icon to save items for later.<br><br>
                Since this is a conceptual project, many of the success metrics don’t apply. However, had this been a real e-commerce website, I would look at the conversion metrics to see if the new launch of Knyts’ e-commerce website and re-branding brought in more revenue at the end of a given quarter.
