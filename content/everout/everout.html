                <h1>Everout - Native iOS mobile application for Local Seattle Events</h1><br>
	   	  		<h2>Background & Problem</h2>
                   <p>EverOut's one goal is to make it as easy as possible for you to go out and have a good time in the city you live in. Founded by the same people behind the popular events calendars at The Stranger and the Portland Mercury, EverOut.com is your one-stop shop to find out about every event and thing to do in town. We want users to be able to quickly and easily find the events you care about, and to maybe discover something new along the way.</p>
                    <p>The organization is also an active force in queer youth engagement and provides LGBTQ-centered trainings that address the needs of the most marginalized people within our community. As a queer person living in Seattle, I chose to assist Gay City due to their locality, unique place at the intersection of building queer and health education and services, and alignment of my values with theirs.</p>

	   	        <h2>Role</h2>
                  <p>I took on a UX Design role in this 2 week design sprint to design a responsive website to inform users of Gay City's resources and help them book healthcare appointments seamlessly.</p><br>
                  <h2>Solution & Result</h2>
                    <p>As a local non-profit as the website stands today, it has been long due for a revamping and has mainly be concerned with staying functional leading to a variety of user experience and overall design issues. Their main online services of informing the general public of community resources and making STI appointments were in need of a redesign.</p>
                    <p>Our goal is to know how EverOut’s current processes for searching, filtering, discovering local Seattle events and locations work for users so that we can translate it into a user-friendly and optimized native mobile application.

	   	          <p class="rightText">
	   	          	I utilized both secondary research on the e-commerce retail space and one on one user interviews of frequent online shoppers to:

                        <li>Determine what aspects of an online store are the most helpful and important to users

      	<h1>Define - Creating a Seamless Shopping Experience</h1>
	      	<p>
	      		To think keep features user-centered, I articulated Problem Statements and How Might We questions (HMW) based on the research. The design was centered around helping users find quality items that is the correct size.

                <li>How might we help Joshua find quality pants that fit him perfectly?

	   	        <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
	   	          <p class="rightText">
	   	          	I had many ideas of what could be on the website, so I narrowed down the most important features that would make a seamless online shopping experience into the project roadmap. From there, I also did an open card sort that helped me grouped features that intuitively went well together. This led to the creation of a site map. This organized categories in a clear way so that users could have an easy to navigate online shopping experience.<br><br>
                    I spent time considering these two things, because I knew that if the website was hard to use, shoppers would be less inclined to make purchases at Knyts online. An easy to navigate website did not only benefit shoppers, it also would be highly beneficial to Knyts meeting their business goals.

            <p>
	      		This project helped me understand the design process specific to native mobile applications and utilizing mobile app components and design systems to iOS. Additionally the <br><br>
                After implementing changes to alleviate original pain points, I will need to conduct further usability testing and research to uncover additional pain points and make more easy to navigate paths for different tasks. Specifically, I will need to conduct A/B testing to see if users are more familiar with a heart icon or bookmark icon to save items for later.<br><br>
                Future improvements include looking at the conversion metrics to see if the new launch of Knyts’ e-commerce website and re-branding brought in more revenue at the end of a given quarter.
