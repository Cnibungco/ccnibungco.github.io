                <h1>Everout - Native iOS Event Discovery Mobile Application</h1><br>
	   	  		<h2>Background & Problem</h2>
                   <p>EverOut's one goal is to make it as easy as possible for you to go out and have a good time in the city you live in. Founded by the same people behind the popular events calendars at The Stranger and the Portland Mercury, EverOut.com is your one-stop shop to find out about every event and thing to do in town. We want users to be able to quickly and easily find the events you care about, and to maybe discover something new along the way.</p>
                    <p>The Stranger wants to translate their web-based events calendar into a native mobile iOS application experience while still staying true to the branding and quirky charm of Seattle's alternative weekly and bringing in more viewership and attendance with their local business partners.</p>

	   	        <h2>Role</h2>
                  <p>I took on a UX Design role in this 2 week design sprint to design an end-to-end native mobile application for Everout to allow users to easily discover, save, and share events near them</p><br>
                  <h2>Solution & Result</h2>
                    <p>Everout has no mobile presence and they can increase user engagement on the site and increase in-person turnout.</p>
                    <p>Our goal is to know how EverOut’s current processes for searching, filtering, discovering local Seattle events and locations work for users so that we can translate it into a user-friendly and optimized native mobile application.

                <h1>Define - Making Event Discovery Easy</h1>
                    <p>
                        To think keep features user-centered, I articulated Problem Statements and How Might We questions (HMW) based on the research. The design was centered around helping users find events catered to their personal interests and locale.
                    <ol class="largeText">
                        <li>How might we help both tourists and locals find events happening in Seattle?

                        <li>How might we inform new users of the application's features without making it overtly difficult to navigate
                        </li><br>

	   	          <p class="rightText">
	   	          	Creating a Site Map for the Mobile application proved to be difficult as it as I was stuck between deciding to have or not have an account creation process. Given that the user research showed that users would much rather save and explore events without having to create an account also since the business is low-impact and has no bandwidth to support data collection, I opted to create a no-account solution. This would keep users on the app for much longer and improve event and app publicity without the hurdle of an account.

            <h2>Key Takeaways & Future Plans</h2>
            <p>
	      		This project helped me understand the design process specific to native mobile applications and utilizing mobile app components and design systems to iOS. I also learned a great deal about working with a fixed company brand and style and the collaborating with their print designer.<br><br>
                After implementing changes to alleviate original pain points, I will need to conduct further usability testing and research to uncover additional pain points and make more easy to navigate paths for different tasks. Specifically, I will need to conduct A/B testing to see if users are more familiar with a heart icon or bookmark icon to save items for later.<br><br>
                Future improvements include eventually adding a login/account creation feature, social media integration to see if your friends are also going to similar events, and a modal for sharing events as well.
