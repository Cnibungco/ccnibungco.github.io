                <h1>Bandcamp – Adding a Discovery Feature</h1><br>
	   	  		<h2>Background & Problem</h2>
                   <p>Bandcamp is an online record store and music community where passionate fans discover, connect with, and directly support the artists they love. Bandcamp’s mission is to help spread the healing power of music by building a community where artists thrive through the direct support of their fans, and where fans gather to explore the amazing musical universe that their direct support helps create.</p>
                    <p>One of Bandcamp's weaker points as a music platform is music discovery something that other music applications do well because of "The Algorithm" (TM). However Bandcamp tries to mitigate this with quality music journalism through the Bandcamp Daily which has grown significantly in popularity.</p>

	   	        <h2>Role</h2>
                  <p>I took on a UX Design role in this 2 week design sprint to design a fully fleshed out Discovery page feature to increase user engagement.</p><br>
                  <h2>Solution & Result</h2>
                    <p>For this project, we are creating a feature on Bandcamp to assist users in discovering new music by aggregating related Bandcamp Daily blog posts into a consolidated Discovery page feature.</p>
                    <p>Our goal is to know how Bandcamp’s current processes for discovering new music works for users through the Bandcamp Daily so that we can translate it into a more user-friendly discovery experience.</p>

	   	          	To think keep features user-centered, I articulated Problem Statements and How Might We questions (HMW) based on the research. The design was centered around helping users find information about Gay City or schedule health checkups.

	   	          <p class="rightText">
	   	          	I had many ideas of what could be on the website, so I narrowed down the most important features that would make a seamless online experience into the project roadmap. From there, I also did an open card sort that helped me grouped features that intuitively went well together. This led to the creation of a site map. This organized categories in a clear way so that users could have an easy to navigate online experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I spent time considering these two things, because I knew that if the website was hard to use, users would be less inclined to stay on the website. An easy to navigate website did not only benefit users, it also would be highly beneficial to Gay City to meet their business goals.

		      	<p>
		      		Through multiple rounds of workshops, UX sketching, and user journey mapping with sticky notes, we identified  fundamental issues within the current version of Gay City. User pain-points included incoherent navigation and site structure. In addition, the build interface looked markedly different from the end-user search interface, making it harder for first time users to see the direct impact and value of their work.

	   	          	I wanted to bring out themes I gathered from Gay City: cultivating access and connections to promote self-determination, liberation and joy in our communities. They use a heavy shade of green to emphasize these values and bring a health-focused impact to the community. To start, I created a style tile to give a visual representation of Gay City.

      	<h2>Key Takeaways & Future Plans</h2>

	      	<p>
	      		I managed to take Gay City's current status as a local community resource and incorporate it's mission and values into more aligned values. It also taught me the importance of collaboration with a client and how to work within the constraints set forth by them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our collaborative work led to improved time and cost savings and reduced employee workloads. With the client, we were able to come together to create a better product and streamlined process for making appointments online. Future improvements also include adding a community events page, resources list, and meet your testers feature to help users feel more acquainted and comfortable with the community center's services.
